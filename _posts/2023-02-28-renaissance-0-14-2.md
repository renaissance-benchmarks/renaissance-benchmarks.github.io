We have released a maintenance update of the Renaissance benchmark suite with
two changes in the underlying libraries. One is to avoid packaging vulnerable
versions of the `log4j` framework and the other is to improve compatibility 
with the LoongArch64 processor architecture.

Even though we believe that the Renaissance suite itself (and the way it is
used) is not susceptible to the vulnerabilities, the presence of JAR files with
vulnerable classes can trigger alarms from various security scanners in some
environments. We have removed the `log4j` library from all (even transitive)
dependencies and replaced it with the `reload4j` library where necessary. The
logging configuration of the Apache Spark, Twitter Finagle, and Akka benchmarks
was updated to restore the previous behavior.

To improve compatibility with the LoongArch64 processor architecture, we 
updated the JNA library to a version that includes support for the processor.

See the pull requests referenced in the [GitHub release](https://github.com/renaissance-benchmarks/renaissance/releases/tag/v0.14.2) for more details.


Any comments and contributions are welcome.

Happy benchmarking!

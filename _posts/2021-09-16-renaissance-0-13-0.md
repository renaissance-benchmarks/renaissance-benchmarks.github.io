We are pleased to announce a new release of the Renaissance benchmark
suite. This release is primarily a **JDK compatibility update**, introducing
support for the newly released JDK17. The Renaissance suite now supports
the complete set of LTS releases of the JDK (JDK8, JDK11, and JDK17) on
Linux, MacOS X, and Windows. A few benchmarks have dependencies that limit
their compatibility to a particular range of JDK versions and these are 
automatically excluded when running the suite on an unsupported JDK.

The changes in this release are minimal. The most important one just brings
the Scala 2.12 benchmarks over to Scala 2.12.15, which now properly supports
JDK17 -- we merely pass on the compatibility improvements provided by the
Scala community! This change affects the following benchmarks, which were
previously using Scala 2.12.14:

- `finagle-chirper`, `finagle-http`
- `neo4j-analytics`
- `philosophers`, `scala-stm-bench7`
- `reactors`
- all `apache-spark` workloads

Here we just want to note that *no benchmark code has been changed* in this
release, only project documentation and parts of the harness responsible for
plugin loading (plugin main class can be now specified in its manifest).


We welcome any comments and contributions.

Happy benchmarking!

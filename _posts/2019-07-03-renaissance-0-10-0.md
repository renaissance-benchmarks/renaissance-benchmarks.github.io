Two months after the announcement of the Renaissance benchmark
suite, we are pleased to release version 0.10.0 that includes a new
benchmark, several improvements and bug fixes.

Most importantly, we added the `scala-doku` benchmark which is a
Sudoku solver written in Scala. Other changes include making
`finagle-http` more parallel, addressing an important bug in
`finagle-chirper` and removing the native libraries dependencies of
`db-shootout`. Moreover, the compatibility with different architectures
has been improved and JDK11 is now also supported.
All changes are listed in [the GitHub release](https://github.com/renaissance-benchmarks/renaissance/releases/tag/v0.10.0).

The numerous reports and positive feedback from the community are very
encouraging and show a quick adoption of the suite across the industry.
It helps companies like Oracle, IBM or SAP track performance
and/or fix bugs. For instance, [this OpenJ9 bug](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/issues/5726)
running Apache Spark has been spotted thanks to the Renaissance suite.

We address special thanks to:
- [tkrodriguez](https://github.com/tkrodriguez) from Oracle for the in-depth analysis of the `finagle-chirper` bug
- [vkostyukov](https://github.com/vkostyukov) from Twitter, for his feedback on the Finagle benchmarks
- [MBaesken](https://github.com/MBaesken) and the SAP Machine team for compatibility testing on less common infrastructures
